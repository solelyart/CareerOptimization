## ❓ FAQ for Recruiters

**Q: What if the VA isn't a good fit after the trial?**  
A: I pay only for work completed (prorated). No long-term commitment. This is why we start with a trial.

**Q: Can the VA work async or do they need to be available for calls?**  
A: Mostly async! Only 3 calls needed: 30-min kickoff (Day 1), 30-min practice (Day 2), 30-min review (Day 7). Rest is independent work.

**Q: What's the full project if the trial goes well?**  
A: Remaining 12 platforms (30-40 hours over 3-4 weeks). Same quality standards. Estimated $1,350-1,800.

**Q: Is this remote work?**  
A: 100% remote. VA can work from anywhere (US-based preferred for time zone overlap, but not required).

**Q: What tools does the VA need?**  
A: Computer, internet, and secure password manager (LastPass/1Password). I provide all content and guides.

**Q: What happens if the VA takes longer than 10 hours?**  
A: If quality is excellent but timing is slower, we can discuss paying for extra hours. If it's a skill/speed issue, that's a red flag.
