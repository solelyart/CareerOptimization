## ❓ FAQ

**Q: What if the VA takes longer than 10 hours?**
A: Discuss before trial. If quality is good but timing is off, consider paying for extra hours. If it's a skill issue, this is a red flag.

**Q: Can I change the 3 platforms?**
A: Yes! These are recommended for difficulty range, but you can substitute others (e.g., Upwork instead of Wyzant).

**Q: What if I'm not satisfied with the trial?**
A: Provide specific feedback. If VA can't correct issues after 1-2 rounds, end trial and look for someone else. Pay only for completed work.

**Q: Should I pay upfront?**
A: No. Pay after Phase 2 (mini project) is completed. This protects you.

**Q: How do I find a good VA?**
A: Use the evaluation questions in this package. Check reviews. Ask for portfolio examples. Trust your gut on communication.

**Q: What happens after the trial?**
A: If successful, sign full project SOW for remaining 12 platforms. If you chose Option C pricing, apply $150 trial credit.
