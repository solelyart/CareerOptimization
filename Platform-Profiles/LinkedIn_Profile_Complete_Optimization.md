- Professional attire or smart casual
- Smile genuinely (warm and approachable)
- Plain or softly blurred background
- Good lighting (natural light preferred)
- Face should take up 60% of the frame

**Option 2: Professional Photographer ($100-300)**
- Search Google: "[Your city] professional headshot photographer"
- Many offer "LinkedIn headshot packages" ($100-150 for 15 min session)
- You'll get 5-10 edited photos to choose from
- Worth the investment - photo is first impression

**Option 3: AI Headshot Services ($20-50)**

- Quality varies, but acceptable for quick solution

**Photo Specifications:**
- File format: JPG or PNG
- Minimum size: 400 x 400 pixels

### Complete Optimized About Section:

```
I help growing companies transform their operations through strategic Salesforce implementations, business process automation, and Agile project delivery—delivering results like 35% increases in user adoption and 40% improvements in operational efficiency.

HOW I GOT HERE

After earning my B.S. in Information Systems, I fell in love with the challenge of bridging the gap between technology and business needs. Over the past 5+ years at companies like Advanced Sterilization Products and Accruent, I've led digital transformation initiatives that didn't just implement technology—they fundamentally changed how organizations work.

WHAT I DO BEST

🎯 Salesforce CRM Optimization
I don't just configure Salesforce—I transform it into a strategic asset. At ASP, I architected a complete CRM transformation that achieved a 35% increase in user adoption in the first quarter, along with 20% productivity gains and 40% faster incident resolution. The secret? Understanding that technology adoption is 20% configuration and 80% change management.

⚙️ Business Process Automation
I identify bottlenecks and engineer solutions that eliminate manual work. At Accruent, I designed a DocuSign CLM integration that slashed contract processing time by 30% and turnaround time by 40%, directly contributing to a 25% improvement in revenue retention. Every automation I build includes clear ROI metrics.

🚀 Agile Project Leadership
I've successfully transitioned multiple organizations to Agile methodologies, reducing release timelines by 25% through optimized sprint planning and stakeholder engagement. I speak both "technical" and "business" fluently, which means projects stay aligned with strategic goals.

MY APPROACH

I believe in:
✓ Data-driven decisions backed by clear KPIs
✓ User-centered design (technology should work for people, not the other way around)
✓ Transparent communication (no surprises, ever)
✓ Continuous improvement (launch is just the beginning)
✓ Measurable outcomes (every project should have an ROI)

CURRENT FOCUS

• Leading Salesforce transformations for healthcare technology companies
• Pursuing Salesforce Administrator and Certified ScrumMaster certifications
• Exploring AI automation and low-code solutions
• Available for select consulting projects (Salesforce optimization, process automation, Agile coaching)

INDUSTRIES I SERVE

Healthcare Technology • SaaS Platforms • Financial Services • E-commerce • Manufacturing Technology • Facility Management

LET'S CONNECT

If you're struggling with:
❓ Low Salesforce user adoption
❓ Manual processes eating up your team's time
