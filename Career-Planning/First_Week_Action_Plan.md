## 🚨 Week 1 Troubleshooting

**"I didn't finish everything on this plan"**
- That's OKAY! This is an ambitious plan.
- Prioritize: Upwork + LinkedIn + Proposals > everything else
- If you got those 3 done, you're on track

**"I'm not getting responses to proposals"**
- Normal in Week 1 (responses come in Week 2-3)
- Keep submitting (volume matters)
- Response rate typically 10-20%
- If Week 2 still no responses: Revise proposal template

**"I'm overwhelmed"**
- Take a break
- Re-read the QUICK_START_CHECKLIST.md
- Focus on just 1 thing: Submit 3 proposals today
- Then 1 more thing: Send 5 network messages
- Small progress > no progress

**"Should I keep studying for certifications?"**
- Not in Week 1-2
- Focus 100% on getting clients
- Resume certifications in Week 8-12 (after first clients)

**"How long until I get my first client?"**
- Average: 2-4 weeks for first interview
- Average: 4-8 weeks for first contract
- You're right on schedule
- Keep proposing, keep networking
