**Tuesday-Thursday:**
- Submit 2-3 proposals daily
- Work on client projects
- 1 hour networking/content

**Weekend:**

---

## 🎯 Key Success Factors

**Do These Daily:**
✅ Submit 2-3 high-quality proposals
✅ Over-communicate with active clients
✅ Spend 15-20 minutes on LinkedIn engagement
✅ Track all activities and metrics

**Avoid These Pitfalls:**
❌ Applying to jobs you're not qualified for (lowers success rate)
❌ Underpricing to win projects (race to the bottom)
❌ Over-delivering without compensation (scope creep)
❌ Neglecting to ask for testimonials/reviews
❌ Focusing on too many platforms at once

**Remember:**
- **Month 1 is about LEARNING** (expect low revenue)
- **Month 2 is about MOMENTUM** (expect some revenue)
- **Month 3 is about SCALING** (expect good revenue)

The first few weeks will feel slow. That's normal. Your pipeline takes 2-4 weeks to fill. By Week 8, you should have consistent flow of opportunities.
