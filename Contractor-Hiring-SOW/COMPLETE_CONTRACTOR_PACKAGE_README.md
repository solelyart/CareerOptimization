## 💡 Pro Tips

**Hiring Tips:**
1. **Don't rush.** Spend 1-2 weeks finding the right contractor. Quality matters!
2. **Check references.** Always contact at least 2 past clients.
3. **Start small.** Consider asking contractor to do just 1 platform as a "test" first.
4. **Use milestones.** Never pay 100% upfront. The 4-milestone schedule protects you.
5. **Communicate clearly.** Over-communicate expectations to avoid disappointment.

**Project Tips:**
1. **Review weekly.** Don't wait until Week 4 to review all work.
2. **Provide feedback fast.** Respond within 2 business days to keep project on track.
3. **Be specific.** If revisions needed, give specific examples, not "make it better."
4. **Ask questions.** Use the 30-day support period to ask anything!
5. **Save everything.** Keep all deliverables in secure, backed-up location.

**Launch Tips:**
1. **Start immediately.** As soon as profiles are live, start submitting proposals.
2. **Follow the 90-day plan.** It's designed to build momentum systematically.
3. **Update profiles.** As you earn certifications, add them to all platforms.
4. **Track metrics.** Use the dashboard to see which platforms generate best results.
5. **Iterate.** If not getting responses, A/B test headlines and bios.

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Do I need all 15 platforms?**
A: No! You can reduce scope. High priority: Upwork, LinkedIn, Braintrust, Indeed, Wyzant. Consider starting with these 5 and adding others later.

**Q: Can I hire multiple contractors?**
A: Yes! Consider hiring specialist for Upwork (Muhammad T. from research), specialist for LinkedIn (Ruchira from research), then DIY the rest using their professional content as templates. This is the "hybrid approach."

**Q: What if I already have some platforms set up?**
A: Great! Reduce scope and price accordingly. Contractor can optimize existing profiles instead of creating from scratch.

**Q: How do I know if the contractor did a good job?**
A: Use the QA Checklist. If it passes all checks and you're receiving profile views/invitations within 30 days, they did well.

**Q: What if we have disagreements about quality?**
A: Refer to the SOW acceptance criteria. If contractor met the written standards, pay them. If they didn't, use revision process. If still unresolved, use dispute resolution process in SOW.

**Q: Should I pay hourly or flat fee?**
A: Flat fee is recommended. It provides cost certainty and incentivizes efficiency. Hourly is fine if you prefer flexibility.

**Q: Do I need to provide LinkedIn info?**
A: If you already have LinkedIn, yes - provide login so contractor can optimize. If you don't have LinkedIn, contractor will create new.
