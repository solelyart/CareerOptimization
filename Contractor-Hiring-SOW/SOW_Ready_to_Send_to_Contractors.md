- Platforms do not significantly change their signup processes during project
- Client will purchase FlexJobs subscription
- Client has legitimate credentials for all required fields

### Dependencies
- **Platform Availability:** Platforms must be operational (no extended downtime)
- **Platform Approval Processes:** Some platforms (Toptal, Chegg, BELAY, UMGC) have approval processes outside contractor control
- **Client Responsiveness:** Project timeline assumes client feedback within 2 business days
- **Third-Party Services:** Background checks (Wyzant), document verification (Chegg) may take additional time

---

## 14. Risks & Mitigation

### Risk: Platform Rejects Application (Toptal, Chegg, BELAY)

**Mitigation:**
- Contractor optimizes application to highest possible standard
- Client understands platform approval outside contractor control
- No penalty to contractor if platform rejects application
- Contractor delivers application completion documentation regardless

### Risk: Project Timeline Extends Beyond 4 Weeks

**Mitigation:**
- Buffer days built into each week
- Weekly check-ins identify issues early
- Clear communication about any delays
- Extensions agreed upon in writing with adjusted timeline

### Risk: Client Unavailable for Feedback

**Mitigation:**
- Client commits to 2-business-day review SLA
- Contractor proceeds with best judgment if client delayed
- Payment milestones still due if delay is client-caused

### Risk: Scope Creep

**Mitigation:**
- Clear SOW defines exactly what's included
- Any additions require written change order
- Additional work billed at hourly rate
- Both parties agree to scope boundaries

---

## 15. Dispute Resolution

### Issue Escalation Process

**Step 1: Direct Communication**
- Contractor and client discuss issue directly
- Attempt to resolve within 2 business days
- Document agreement in writing

**Step 2: Mediation**
- If unresolved, both parties agree to mediation
- Use platform dispute resolution (if hired through Upwork/Fiverr)
- Or mutually agreed upon third-party mediator

**Step 3: Partial Payment**
- If project cannot be completed, client pays for completed milestones only
- Pro-rated payment for partial milestone completion
- Both parties release each other from further obligations

### Grounds for Termination

**Client May Terminate If:**
- Contractor misses 2+ deadlines without valid reason
- Quality of work significantly below standards after 2 revision rounds
- Contractor violates confidentiality agreement
- Contractor becomes unresponsive (no communication for 5+ business days)

**Contractor May Terminate If:**
- Client fails to provide required materials after 5 business days
- Client fails to pay approved milestones after 7 business days
- Client makes excessive revision requests beyond scope
- Project becomes untenable due to client behavior

**Termination Process:**
- 7-day written notice required
- Payment for completed work to date
- Return or destruction of all client materials
- Professional transition of any access/accounts
