## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Have you worked with all 15 of these platforms?**
A: I have direct experience with [X number] of the platforms: [list them]. For the platforms I haven't personally used, I will thoroughly research their requirements and best practices to ensure high-quality setup. My writing and optimization skills are transferable across all platforms.

**Q: What if a platform rejects an application (like Toptal)?**
A: As outlined in the SOW, I will optimize applications to the highest possible standard. However, platforms like Toptal, Chegg, and BELAY have their own approval processes that are outside my control. My responsibility is delivering a high-quality application; platform approval decisions are between you and the platform.

**Q: What happens if I need more than 2 rounds of revisions?**
A: The first 2 rounds of revisions per platform are included. If you need additional changes beyond that, I'm happy to accommodate at $[amount]/hour. In my experience, most clients are satisfied after 1-2 rounds, so this rarely comes up.

**Q: Can you help with ongoing profile maintenance after the project?**
A: Absolutely! I offer post-project support at $[amount]/hour or a monthly retainer of $[amount]/month for [X] hours. This includes updates, new content, adding certifications, etc.

**Q: What if I'm not satisfied with a profile?**
A: Client satisfaction is my top priority. If you're not satisfied, I'll revise until you are (within the scope of work). If we can't reach a mutually satisfactory outcome, we can part ways and you'll only pay for completed, approved milestones.

**💡 Questions to Ask During Interview:**
- "Walk me through your exact process for setting up an Upwork profile."
- "What's your strategy for optimizing content for ATS systems on job boards?"
- "How do you ensure consistency across multiple platforms?"
- "Can you share a before/after example of a profile you optimized?"
