## Full-Service Agencies (Alternative Option)

If you prefer working with a company rather than an individual freelancer, these are the best options. However, be aware that they will be **more expensive** and **less flexible** than hiring a freelancer for a custom project.

| Service | Best For | Estimated Cost (for a limited scope) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **TopResume** | Resume + LinkedIn + Cover Letter | **$349+** |
| **Career Launch Campus** | Job Seeker Coaching (Resume + LinkedIn) | **$127 (currently $38)** |

**Note:** These agencies **do not** offer setup for the full range of freelance and educational platforms you require. You would still need to hire a separate freelancer to complete the project.
