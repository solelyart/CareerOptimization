- Celebrate small wins

**❌ DON'T:**
- Wait until all 15 platforms are "perfect" to start proposing
- Spend more than 2 hours on any single platform setup
- Price below $65/hr (you're worth more)
- Pursue all income streams simultaneously (pick 2-3)
- Obsess over certifications in Month 1 (earn first, certify later)

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

**"I'm not getting any responses to proposals"**
- Check: Are you customizing each proposal? (Don't use templates)
- Check: Is your rate competitive? ($80-100/hr sweet spot for beginners)
- Check: Are you applying within 15 minutes of job posting? (Speed matters)
- Solution: Revise proposal template, lower rate slightly, increase volume

**"I can't afford to hire a contractor"**
- Solution: DIY using Complete_Implementation_Guide_for_Contractors.md
- Time required: 40-50 hours over 4 weeks = 10-12 hours/week
- Savings: $1,500-$2,500

**"I'm overwhelmed by how much there is to do"**
- Solution: Focus ONLY on Week 1 checklist above
- Remember: You don't need perfection, you need momentum
- Read: First_Week_Action_Plan.md for detailed daily breakdown

**"Should I get certified before starting?"**
- Answer: NO (unless you have 6+ months runway with no income pressure)
- Better: Start earning, then certify in Month 3-4
- Exception: If not getting responses after 50 proposals, then certify
