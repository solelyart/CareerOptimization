## 🔐 Security Best Practices

**Before You Start:**

1. **Use a Password Manager (Recommended)**
   - **Best Options:**
     - 1Password ($36/year) - Most user-friendly
     - Bitwarden (Free or $10/year) - Open-source, secure
     - LastPass (Free tier available) - Popular, easy to use
     - Dashlane ($60/year) - Premium features
   - **Why:** Encrypted storage, auto-fill, password generation, secure sharing
   - **Setup:** Install browser extension, create master password, add credentials as you create them

2. **Or: Use Encrypted Spreadsheet**
   - **Tools:** Microsoft Excel with password protection, Google Sheets (private)
   - **File Name:** "Platform_Credentials_PRIVATE.xlsx"
   - **Storage:** Local drive only (NOT cloud unless encrypted)
   - **Add to .gitignore:** Ensure never committed to version control

3. **Never:**
   - ❌ Store passwords in plain text files (.txt, .doc)
   - ❌ Save passwords in browser without master password
   - ❌ Email passwords to anyone (including contractors - use secure sharing)
   - ❌ Reuse same password across platforms
   - ❌ Use simple passwords (no "Password123!")

## Security & Password Best Practices

### Strong Password Guidelines

**Weak Password Examples (NEVER USE):**
- ❌ Password123
- ❌ Kristen2024
- ❌ 123456789
- ❌ qwerty
- ❌ YourName!

**Strong Password Examples:**
- ✅ 8$mK9#pL2@vN5qR7 (random characters)
- ✅ correct-horse-battery-staple-2024! (passphrase method)
- ✅ BlueElephant$Dances!47 (memorable but complex)

**Password Generator Tools:**
- 1Password generator (built-in)
- LastPass generator
- Bitwarden generator
- Random.org/passwords

**Requirements for Strong Passwords:**
- At least 16 characters
- Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
- No dictionary words
- No personal info (name, birthday, pet name)
- Unique for every platform

---

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Setup

**Recommended 2FA Method: Authenticator App**

**Best Authenticator Apps:**
- **Authy** (Free) - Multi-device sync, cloud backup
- **Google Authenticator** (Free) - Simple, widely supported
- **Microsoft Authenticator** (Free) - Works with Microsoft accounts
- **1Password** (Paid) - Built-in authenticator if you use 1Password

**How to Set Up 2FA:**
1. Go to platform's Security Settings
2. Choose "Enable Two-Factor Authentication"
3. Select "Authenticator App" (not SMS if possible - SMS is less secure)
4. Scan QR code with authenticator app
5. **SAVE BACKUP CODES** (store in password manager or print and secure)
6. Test login with 2FA to ensure it works

**Enable 2FA on These Platforms (Priority Order):**
1. ✅ Upwork (protects your earnings)
2. ✅ LinkedIn (prevents account takeover)
3. ✅ Email account (protects everything)
4. ✅ Banking/PayPal (financial security)
5. ✅ All other platforms (as available)

---

## Credentials Sharing with Contractor (If Hiring One)

**If you hire a contractor to set up platforms, here's how to share credentials securely:**

### Option 1: Password Manager Guest Access
- 1Password: Create "Guest" account, share specific credentials
- Bitwarden: Create "Organization," invite contractor with limited permissions
- LastPass: Use "Share" feature for specific items
- **Revoke access after project completion**

### Option 2: Create Temporary Credentials
- Create accounts with temporary passwords
- Share via secure methods (see below)
- Change passwords after contractor delivers work

### Option 3: Contractor Creates Accounts (You Don't Share Passwords)
- Give contractor YOUR information (resume, bio, etc.)
- Contractor creates accounts using YOUR email
- You set passwords via "forgot password" flow
- More secure but requires more coordination

**NEVER:**
- ❌ Email passwords in plain text
- ❌ Share via unsecured document
- ❌ Give contractor access to financial accounts
- ❌ Leave contractor access enabled after project ends

**Secure Sharing Methods:**
- ✅ 1Password/LastPass sharing feature
- ✅ Encrypted file (7-Zip with password, sent separately)
- ✅ One-time secret (onetimesecret.com) - link expires after viewing
- ✅ Secure messaging (Signal, ProtonMail encrypted)

---

## Credential Recovery Information

**Save these in SEPARATE secure location (not with passwords):**

### Master Recovery Information

| What | Where Stored | Notes |
|------|--------------|-------|
| Master password (for password manager) | Paper in fireproof safe OR trusted family member | Don't store digitally |
| Recovery email | [Secondary email address] | Check regularly |
| Recovery phone | [Your phone number] | Keep updated |
| Backup codes (for 2FA) | Print + store in safe, OR password manager | Save when setting up 2FA |
| Security question answers | Password manager (encrypted notes) | Use fake answers for better security |

---

## Regular Maintenance Schedule

**Weekly:**
- ☐ Update credentials if you created new accounts
- ☐ Check for password expiration warnings
- ☐ Review account status (any requiring action?)

**Monthly:**
- ☐ Change passwords for high-value accounts (Upwork, banking)
- ☐ Review payment method on file for subscriptions
- ☐ Check for unusual login activity

**Quarterly:**
- ☐ Audit all accounts - which are you using?
- ☐ Close unused accounts (reduce attack surface)
- ☐ Update recovery email/phone if changed
- ☐ Backup password manager data

**Annually:**
- ☐ Change ALL passwords (if not using unique passwords)
- ☐ Review security questions and answers
- ☐ Update backup and recovery codes

---

## Emergency: Account Compromised

**If you suspect an account has been hacked:**

1. **Immediately:**
   - Change password
   - Log out all devices
   - Enable 2FA (if not already)
   - Review recent activity/transactions

2. **Check for damage:**
   - Upwork/Freelance platforms: Check for unauthorized proposals/messages
   - LinkedIn: Check for spam posts from your account
   - Banking: Check for unauthorized transactions

3. **Report:**
   - Contact platform support
   - File report if financial fraud involved
   - Warn network connections (if account sent spam)

4. **Prevent future:**
   - Identify how breach occurred (weak password? phishing? malware?)
   - Install antivirus/anti-malware
   - Review all other accounts for similar vulnerabilities
