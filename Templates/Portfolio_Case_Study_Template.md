## Why Case Studies Matter

**Difference Between Resume Bullet Point vs. Case Study:**

**Resume Bullet (Weak):**
> "Implemented Salesforce CRM, improving user adoption by 35%"

**Case Study (Strong):**
> A 200-person medical device company was struggling with 18% Salesforce adoption after 2 years. Sales reps were maintaining parallel spreadsheets, causing data inconsistencies and missed opportunities. I led a comprehensive CRM optimization project that included user interviews, workflow redesign, and targeted training. Within 6 months, adoption increased to 53% (+35 percentage points), eliminating duplicate data entry and providing leadership with real-time visibility into the sales pipeline worth $12M.

**Case studies sell. Bullets inform.**

## Case Study Template Structure

**Use this structure for each project:**

### 1. PROJECT TITLE (Compelling + Specific)

**Format:** [Action Verb] + [Outcome] + [Context]

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Transforming Salesforce Adoption: 35% Increase at Medical Device Manufacturer"
- ✅ "Reducing Contract Cycle Time by 30% Through Automated Workflows"
- ✅ "Rescuing a Failed ERP Implementation: Achieving 98% User Acceptance"

❌ "Salesforce Project at ASP" (too generic)

---

### 2. CLIENT OVERVIEW (2-3 sentences)

**Include:**
- Industry
- Company size (employees, revenue if public)
- Business model (B2B, B2C, etc.)
- Key challenge/pain point

**Example:**
> Advanced Sterilization Products (ASP) is a medical device manufacturer with 200+ employees, specializing in healthcare sterilization solutions. The company operates in a highly regulated industry requiring strict compliance documentation and complex sales processes involving multiple stakeholders and lengthy approval cycles.

---

### 3. THE CHALLENGE (Problem Statement) (1 paragraph)

**Structure:**
- What was broken?
- Why did it matter?
- What was at stake?
- What had been tried before?

**Example:**
> When I joined, Salesforce CRM adoption was at only 18% after 2 years of implementation. Sales representatives resisted the system, maintaining parallel spreadsheets instead. This created significant data quality issues, with duplicate records, missing contact information, and zero visibility into sales pipeline status. Leadership couldn't forecast accurately, and opportunities were slipping through cracks. The company had invested $150K+ in Salesforce but was seeing almost no return. Previous training initiatives had failed due to system complexity and lack of workflow alignment with actual sales processes.

**Key Elements to Include:**
- Specific metrics showing severity (18% adoption, $150K invested)
- Real-world consequences (opportunities slipping, can't forecast)
- Why previous attempts failed (training without workflow redesign)
- Emotional element (frustration, resistance)

---

### 4. MY ROLE & APPROACH (1-2 paragraphs)

**Structure:**
- Your title/role
- Team composition (if applicable)
- Methodology used (Agile, Waterfall, etc.)
- Key phases of your approach

**Example:**
> As Senior Business Systems Analyst, I led the CRM optimization initiative working with a cross-functional team of 8 including sales leadership, IT, and operations. I employed an Agile approach with 2-week sprints to allow for continuous feedback and iteration.

> My methodology included four key phases:
> 1. **Discovery** (Weeks 1-2): Conducted 24 user interviews with sales reps, managers, and executives to understand pain points and identify workflow gaps.
> 2. **Process Redesign** (Weeks 3-6): Mapped current vs. ideal state workflows, identifying 17 unnecessary steps causing friction. Worked with stakeholders to redesign processes aligned with actual sales motions.
> 3. **System Configuration** (Weeks 7-10): Simplified Salesforce interface, automated 12 manual data entry tasks, created custom reports for each role, and integrated with email and calendar.
> 4. **Change Management** (Weeks 11-24): Delivered role-specific training (not generic demos), created quick-reference guides, established "CRM Champions" program, and provided ongoing support via weekly office hours.

**Key Elements:**
- Your leadership/involvement level
- Team dynamics
- Structured approach (shows you're methodical)
- Specific techniques used (user interviews, workflow mapping, training)

---

### 5. SOLUTIONS IMPLEMENTED (Bullet List)

**Technical + Process + People Solutions**

**Example:**

**Technical Solutions:**

---

### 6. RESULTS & IMPACT (Quantified Outcomes)

**Structure: Metric + Context + Business Impact**

**Example:**

**Adoption & Usage:**
- Increased Salesforce adoption from 18% to 53% (+35 percentage points) within 6 months
- Achieved 95% daily active users among Account Executives (up from 25%)
- Reduced "shadow spreadsheet" usage from 80% of reps to 5%

**Efficiency Gains:**
- Reduced time spent on data entry by 40% (saving 8 hours/week per sales rep)
- Decreased time to generate executive reports from 4 hours to 10 minutes (automation)
- Eliminated 12 hours/week of duplicate data cleanup

**Business Outcomes:**
- Improved forecast accuracy from 62% to 89% (more reliable revenue projections)
- Increased visibility into $12M sales pipeline (previously invisible)
- Reduced lost opportunities by 18% (better follow-up and reminders)
- Improved data quality: Duplicate records decreased from 23% to 2%

**Financial Impact:**
- ROI: $150K investment now generating $85K/year in productivity savings
- Payback period: 1.8 years
- Estimated revenue impact: $280K in prevented lost opportunities (Year 1)

**Qualitative Impact:**
- Sales team satisfaction score increased from 3.2/10 to 8.1/10
- Leadership now has real-time visibility for strategic decisions
- Company able to scale sales team (hired 15 new reps) using standardized CRM

---

### 7. KEY TAKEAWAYS / LESSONS LEARNED (Optional, 2-3 bullets)

**Example:**
- **User-centered design is critical:** The original implementation failed because IT built what they thought sales needed, not what sales actually needed. User interviews and co-design sessions were game-changers.
- **Change management > technology:** The technical fixes were straightforward. The hard part was getting 60+ sales reps to change habits. Role-specific training and Champions program made the difference.
- **Quick wins build momentum:** We prioritized "low-hanging fruit" improvements in first 2 sprints (like email integration). Early wins created buy-in for bigger changes later.

---

### 8. TESTIMONIAL (If Available)

**Example:**
> *"Kristen transformed our Salesforce implementation from a $150K paperweight into a mission-critical tool. Her user-centered approach and relentless focus on change management turned around a failed project. Our sales team actually WANTS to use CRM now, which I never thought I'd see."*  
> **— Sarah Mitchell, VP of Sales, Advanced Sterilization Products**

---

### 9. VISUALS TO INCLUDE (For Website/Portfolio)

**Charts/Graphs:**
- Before/After comparison chart (adoption rate: 18% → 53%)
- Timeline showing implementation phases
- Dashboard screenshots (redact sensitive data)

**Process Diagrams:**
- Old workflow (9 steps) vs. new workflow (5 steps)
- System architecture diagram

**Photos:**

## Case Study Writing Tips

**Do:**
✅ Use specific numbers (35%, 40%, 30%, $150K)
✅ Tell a story (beginning, middle, end)
✅ Show your process (not just results)
✅ Include challenges and how you overcame them
✅ Use active voice ("I led..." not "The project was...")
✅ Keep client/company info (if public company or you have permission)

**Don't:**
❌ Make up numbers (if you don't remember exact %, estimate range)
❌ Take credit for team's work (say "I led a team of 8" not "I single-handedly...")
❌ Include sensitive/confidential client data
❌ Write in passive voice ("Results were achieved...")
❌ Focus only on what you did without showing impact
❌ Write more than 1,000 words per case study (800-1,000 is ideal)

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: I don't remember exact numbers. Can I estimate?**
A: Yes, but be honest. Use ranges ("increased adoption by 30-40%") or qualifiers ("reduced processing time by approximately 30%").

**Q: Can I use proprietary information from past employers?**
A: Only if:
   - Company is public (annual reports are public anyway)
   - You have explicit permission
   - You anonymize ("a Fortune 500 medical device company" vs. "Advanced Sterilization Products")
   
**Q: What if my project didn't have perfect outcomes?**
A: Focus on what YOU accomplished and learned. Frame challenges as learning opportunities. "While we aimed for 50% improvement, we achieved 35% due to [factors outside my control]. However, I learned [lesson] which I applied to future projects."

**Q: How long should each case study be?**
A: 
   - **Website version:** 800-1,000 words
   - **Proposal version:** 200-300 words
   - **LinkedIn article version:** 1,000-1,500 words
   - **Interview version:** 3-5 minutes spoken (~500-700 words)

**Q: Do I need permission from past employers to write case studies?**
A: Legally, if you're stating facts and not revealing trade secrets, you're generally okay. But best practice: 
   - Use publicly available information only
   - Or anonymize company name
   - Or ask permission (most companies are fine with positive case studies)
